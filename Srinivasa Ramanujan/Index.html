                <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920), the man who reshaped twentieth-century mathematics with his various
                    contributions in several mathematical domains, including mathematical analysis, infinite series,
                    continued fractions, number theory, and game theory is recognized as one of history's greatest
                    mathematicians. Leaving this world at the youthful age of 32, Ramanujan made significant
                    contributions to mathematics that only a few others could match in their lifetime. Surprisingly, he
                    never received any formal mathematics training. Most of his mathematical discoveries were based only
                    on intuition and were ultimately proven correct. With its humble and sometimes difficult start, his
                    life story is just as fascinating as his incredible work. Every year, Ramanujanâ€™s birth anniversary
                    on December 22 is observed as National Mathematics Day.
